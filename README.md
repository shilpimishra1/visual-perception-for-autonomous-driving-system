# 🚗 Visual Perception for Autonomous Driving System

Visual Perception is a core component of autonomous driving, enabling vehicles to "see" and interpret their surroundings using cameras and computer vision techniques. This system processes real-world data to support safe and intelligent driving decisions.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The objective of this project is to build a robust visual perception system that:
- Detects and understands the environment using image data
- Applies machine learning and image processing for real-time analysis
- Aims to assist autonomous vehicles in making safer decisions on the road

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- OpenCV 📷 (for image processing)
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning models)
- NumPy & Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ Lane detection and tracking
- ✅ Object detection (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs)
- ✅ Real-time video frame processing
- ✅ Designed with road safety as a top priority
